First of all, I would like to thank Tamar, for the infinite patience,
understanding, love and support. I could not have done it without you.

Last, but not least, I want to thank Yossi. There is so much I learned from
  you about science, English, literature, life and “judicial piracy”, that 
  a paragraph just can't express. Every meeting was a learning experience ...
