On a first sight, the proof of \cref{Theorem:Gil-Levy} could follow the techniques
  sketched in \cref{Section:toolkit} to type encode a DPDA (\cref{Definition:DPDA}).
The partial transition function~$δ$ may be type encoded as in \cref{Figure:simple-binary},
and the stack data structure of a DPDA can be encoded as in \cref{Figure:stack-encoding}.

The techniques however fail with~$ε$-transitions,
  which allow the automaton to move between an unbounded number of
  configurations and maneuver the stack in a non-trivial manner,
  without making any progress on the input.
The fault in the scheme lies with compile time computation being carried out
  by the~$\textsf{java}(σ)()$ functions, each converting
  their receiver type to the type of the receiver of the next call in the chain.
We are not aware of a \Java type encoding which makes
  it possible to convert an input type into an output type, where
  the output is a computed from the input by an unbounded number o steps.†{%
    With the presumption that the \Java compiler halts for all inputs (a presumption that does
    not hold for e.g., \CC, and was never proved for \Java), the claim that there is no \Java type encoding for all DPDAs can be proved:
 Employing~$ε$-transitions, it is easy to construct an automaton~$A^∞$ that
  never halts on any input.
A type encoding of~$A^∞$ creates programs that send the compiler in an infinite loop.
}

The literature speaks of finite-delay DPDAs, in which the number
  of consecutive~$ε$-transitions is uniformly bounded and even of
  realtime DPDAs in which this bound is 0, i.e., no~$ε$-transitions.
Our proof relies on a special kind of realtime automata,
  described by Courcelle~\cite{Courcelle:77}.

\begin{Definition}[Simple-Jump Single-State Realtime Deterministic Pushdown Automaton]
  \label{Definition:JDPDA}
  \slshape
  A \textit{simple-jump, single-state, realtime deterministic pushdown automaton}
  (jDPDA, for short) is a triplet~$⟨Γ,γ₁,δ⟩$
  where~$Γ$ is a set of stack elements,~$γ₁∈Γ$ is the initial stack element,
  and~$δ$ is the \emph{partial transition function},~$δ:Γ⨉Σ↛Γ^*∪j(Γ)$,
  \[
    j(Γ) = ❴ \textit{instruction \textup{\textsf{jump}}}(γ) \; | \;γ∈Γ❵.
  \]
  A configuration of a jDPDA is some~$c∈Γ^*$ representing the stack contents.
  Initially, the stack holds~$γ₁$ only.
  For technical reasons, assume that the input terminates with~$\$ \not∈Σ$, a special end-of-file character.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item At each step a jDPDA examines~$γ$,
	  the element at the top of the stack, 
	  and~$σ∈Σ$, the next input character,
	  and executes the following:
          \begin{quote}
            \begin{enumerate}
              \item consume~$σ$
              \item pop~$γ$
              \item if~$δ(γ,σ)=ζ$,~$ζ∈Γ^*$, the automaton pushes~$ζ$ into the stack.
              \item if~$δ(γ,σ)=\textsf{jump}(γ')$,~$γ'∈Γ$, then the automaton repetitively
                    pops stack elements up-to and including the first occurrence of~$γ$.
            \end{enumerate}
          \end{quote}
    \item If the next character is~$\$$, then the automaton may reject or accept (but not do nothing else),
          depending on the value of~$γ$.
  \end{itemize}
  In addition, the automaton rejects if~$δ(γ,σ) =⊥$ (i.e., undefined), or if it encounters
  an empty stack (either at the beginning of a step or on course
  of a \textsf{jump operation}).
\end{Definition}

As it turns out, every DCFL is recognized by some jDPDA, and conversely, 
  every language accepted by a jDPDA
  is a DCFL~\cite{Courcelle:77}.
The proof of \cref{Theorem:Gil-Levy} is therefore reduced to type-encoding of a given jDPDA.
Towards this end, we employ the type-encoding techniques developed above, and, in particular, the jump-stack data structure (\cref{Figure:jump}).

Henceforth, let~$k =|Σ|$,~$ℓ=|Σ|$.
The simple~$k=2$,~$ℓ=2$ jDPDA~$A$ defined in \cref{Table:A} will serve as our running example.
Let~$L$ be the language~$L$ recognized by~$A$.%
†{
  Incidintally,
\[
  L = ❴ σ₁^{n₁}σ₂^{2m₁} σ₁^{n₂}σ₂^{2m₂} ⋯ σ₁^{n_r}σ₂^{2m_r} \; | \; r≥0∧∀r', 1≤r'≤r⇒\sum_{i=1}^{r'} nᵢ≥\sum_{i=1}^{r'} mᵢ
\]
which is clearly not-regular; the equivalence of DCFG and jDPDAs means also that there is an nonambigous, deterministic
BNF for~$L$; neither the BNF nor the above repesentation are material for the proof.

\subsection{Main Types}
Generation of a type encoding for a jDPDA starts with two empty types for sets~$L$,~$Σ^*$:
\begin{quote}
  \javaInput[left=-2ex,minipage,width=54ex]{proof.headers.listing}
\end{quote}
(The full type encoding is in \cref{Figure:A} below; to streamline the reading, we bring
  excerpts as necessary.)

A configuration is encoded by a generic type~\cc{C}.
Essentially,~\cc{C} is a representation of the stack,
  but~$2k+1$ other parameters are required:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \cc{Rest} a type encoding of the stack after a push,
  \item~$k$ types, named \cc{J$γ$1}, … ,\cc{J$γ${}$k$}, encoding the stack
        after~$\textsf{jump}(γ₁)$, … ,$\textsf{jump}(γₖ)$, and,
  \item~$k$ types, named \cc{JR$γ$1}, … ,\cc{JR$γ${}$k$}, encoding the type of \cc{Rest}
    after~$\textsf{jump}{γ₁}$,…~$\textsf{jump}(γₖ)$.
\end{itemize}
(All invocations of~\cc{C} must make sure that actual parameters are properly constrained;
so as to ensure that they are (the type version of) pointers into the actual stack.)

In the running example,~\cc{C} is defined as
\begin{quote}
  \javaInput[left=0ex,minipage,width=63ex]{proof.configuration.listing}
\end{quote}
This excerpt shows also classes~\cc{E} and~\cc{¤} which encode (as in \cref{Figure:jump})
  the empty and the error configurations.

Type~\cc{C} defines~$ℓ+1$ functions (3 in the example), one for each possible input character.
Since~\cc{C} encode an abstract configuration, return types of functions in it
  are appropriate defaults which intentionally fail to emulate the automaton's execution.
  The return type of \cc{\$()} is \cc{ΣΣ} (rejection);
  the transition functions \cc{$σ$1()}, … \cc{$σ${}$ℓ$()}, return the raw type~\cc{C}.

\subsection{Top of Stack Types}

Classes \cc{C$γ$1}, … ,\cc{C$γ${}$k$}, specializing~\cc{C},
  encode stacks whose top element is~$γ₁$, … ,$γₖ$.
In~$A$ there two of these
\begin{quote}
  \javaInput[left=-2ex,minipage,width=45ex]{proof.many.listing}
\end{quote}
This excerpt shows how interdependency in the actual parameters to the type~\cc{C}, e.g.,
  the instantiation of~\cc{C} in \cc{C$γ$1} employs only three
    independent types: \cc{Rest}, \cc{J$γ$1}, and \cc{J$γ$2}.
Selection of the parameters enforces the intended constraints of each of these.
Think, for example, on a stack obtained by pushing \cc{$γ$1} on \cc{Rest}.
In such a stack, the result of~$\textsf{jump}(γ₁)$ must be \cc{Rest}.

In~$A$, types \cc{C$γ$1} and \cc{C$γ$2} take three parameters;
in general ‟Top of Stack" types take~$k+1$ parameters:
\cc{Rest} and the results of~$\cc{Rest.}\textsf{jump}(γᵢ)$,~$i=1,…,k$.
It is the duty of the generated code to instantiates these types
  only with parameters \cc{JR$γ$1}, … ,\cc{JR$γ${}$k$} that satisfy
  these implicit demands.

Note that these~$k+1$ parameters are sufficient for instantiating the base type~\cc{C}, since
  the remaining~$\textsf{jump}(γᵢ)$ parameters of\cc{C}
  are known when the top of the stack is known.
If the top is~$γⱼ$, then for all~$j≠i~$ \[
  \textsf{jump}(γⱼ) =
  \cc{Rest.}\textsf{jump}(γⱼ)
\] whereas~$\textsf{jump}(γᵢ) = \cc{Rest}$.

\subsection{Transitions}
It remains to show the type encoding of~$δ$,
  the transition function.
Overall, there are a total of~$k(ℓ+1)$
  entries in a transition table such as \cref{Table:A}.
Conceptually, these are encoded by selecting the correct return
  type of functions \cc{$σ$()}, … ,\cc{$σ${}$k$()} and \cc{\$()} in each of the ‟Top of Stack” types.
Thanks to inheritance, we need to do so only in the cases that this return type is different from the
  default.

Overall, there are six kinds of entries in a transition table:
\begin{description}
  \item[\textsf{reject}]
  The default return type of \cc{\$()} in~\cc{C} is \cc{$ΣΣ$}, which
  is \emph{not} a subtype of~\cc{L}. Normally the result of a call chain that ends with \cc{\$()}
  cannot be assigned to a variable of type~\cc{L}. Moreover, since \cc{$ΣΣ$} is \kk{private},
  there is little that clients can do with this result.
  \item[\textsf{accept}]
<<<<<<< HEAD
  The only case in which fluent call chain ending with \cc{\$()} can return
  type~\cc{L} is when the type returned of the call just prior to \cc{.\$()} covariantly
  changes the return type of \cc{\$()} to~\cc{L}.†{This is not to be confused with dynamic binding;
  types of fluent API call chains are determined statically.}
  \par
  Recall that a jDPDA can only accept after its input is exhausted.
  In \cref{Table:A} we see that \textsf{accept} occurs when the top of the stack is~$γ₁$.
  We therefore to the body of type \cc{C$γ$1} this line
  \begin{JAVA}
@Override L ¢\gobble$¢$();
  \end{JAVA}
=======
    The only case in which fluent call chain ending with \cc{\$()} can return
      type \cc{L} is when the return type of the call just prior to \cc{.\$()} covriantely changes the return
        type to \cc{L}.
    Examining \cref{Table:A} we see that this happens when the top of the stack is $\gamma_1$. 
    We therefore to the body of type \cc{C$γ$1} this line 
    \begin{JAVA}
@Override L $() ;
    \end{JAVA}
     
    Accordingly 
        the return type
>>>>>>> c377811cb1eabee017c0ec1a125b1c1d7e61d9da
  \item[$⊥$]
  When a prefix of the input is sufficient to conclude it must be rejected however it continues
  the transition function returns~$⊥$.
  In~$A$ this occurs when the top of the stack is~$γ₂$ and a~$σ₁$ character is read.
  To type encode~$δ(γ₁,σ₂) =⊥$, one must \emph{not} override \cc{$σ$2()} in type\cc{C$γ$1};
  the inherited return type (l.17 \cref{Figure:A} is a raw~\cc{C}.
  Subsequent calls in the chain will all receive and return a raw~\cc{C}.
  (Recall that all \cc{$σ${}$i$()}~$i=1,…,ℓ$ functions in~\cc{C} return a raw~\cc{C}.)
  Therefore, the final \cc{\$()} will reject.
  \par
  Two other situations in which a jDPDA rejects but not demonstrated in~$A$ are:
  a \textsf{jump} that encounters an empty stack, and reading a character from when the stack is empty.
  In our type encoding these are handled by the special
  types~\cc{E} and~\cc{¤} (ll.19--20 ibid), both extending~\cc{C} without
  overriding any of its methods. Again, remaining part of the call chain will stick to
  raw~\cc{C}s up until the final \cc{\$()} call rejecting the input.
  \item[$\textsf{jump}(γᵢ)$]
  The design generic parameters makes the implementation of~$\textsf{jump}(γᵢ)$
  operations particularly simple. All that is
  required is to covariantly change the return the
  type of the appropriate \cc{$σ${}$j$} function
  to the appropriate \cc{JR$i$} parameter
  (recall that a jump occurs after popping the current element from the stack, so
  we refer to \cc{JR} type parameters rather than~\cc{J}'s.)
  \par
  In \cref{Table:A} we find that~$δ(γ₂,σ₂ =\textsf{jump}(γ₁)$. Accordingly, the type of \cc{$σ$2()}
  in \cc{C$γ$2} (l.39) is \cc{JR$γ$1}.
  \item[$\textsf{push}(α)$]
