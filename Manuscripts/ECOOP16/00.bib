abstract = {Hibernate practically exploded on the \Java scene. Why is this
  open-source tool so popular? Because it automates a tedious task: persisting
    your \Java objects to a relational database. The inevitable mismatch
    between your object-oriented code and the relational database requires you
    to write code that maps one to the other. This code is often complex,
  tedious and costly to develop. Hibernate does the mapping for you. Not only
    that, Hibernate makes it easy. Positioned as a layer between your
    application and your database, Hibernate takes care of loading and saving
    of objects. Hibernate applications are cheaper, more portable, and more
    resilient to change. And they perform better than anything you are likely
    to develop yourself. "Hibernate in Action" carefully explains the concepts
    you need, then gets you going. It builds on a single example to show you
    how to use Hibernate in practice, how to deal with concurrency and
    transactions, how to efficiently retrieve objects and use caching. The
    authors created Hibernate and they field questions from the Hibernate
    community every day-they know how to make Hibernate sing. Knowledge and
    insight seep out of every pore of this book. "What's Inside" - ORM concepts

@book{Linz:2001,
abstract = {Written to address the fundamentals of formal languages, automata,
  and computabilty, An Introduction to Formal Languages and Automata provides
    an accessible, student-friendly presentation of all material essential to
    an introductory Theory of Computation course. It is designed to familiarize
    students with the foundations and principles of computer science and to
    strengthen the students' ability to carry out formal and rigorous
    mathematical arguments. In the new Fifth Edition, Peter Linz continues to
    offer a straightforward, uncomplicated treatment of formal languages and
    automata and avoids excessive mathematical detail so that students may
    focus on and understand the underlying principles. In an effort to further
    the accessibility and comprehension of the text, the author has added new
    illustrative examples and exercises throughout. There is a substantial
    amount of new material in the form of two new appendices, and a CD-ROM of
    JFLAP exercises authored by Susan Rodger of Duke University. The first
    appendix is an entire chapter on finite-state transducers. This optional
    chapter can be used to prepare students for further related study. The
    second appendix offers a brief introduction to JFLAP; an interactive
    software tool that is of great help in both learning the material and in
    teaching the course. Many of the exercises in the text require creating
    structures that are complicated and that have to be tested for correctness.
    JFLAP can greatly reduce students’ time spent on testing as well as help
    them visualize abstract concepts. The CD-ROM that accompanies this fifth
    edition expands this and offers exercises specific for JFLAP.},

@article{Parr:1995,
abstract = {Despite the parsing power of LR/LALR algorithms, e.g. YACC,
  programmers often choose to write recursive-descent parsers by hand to obtain
    increased flexibility, better error handling, and ease of debugging. We
    introduce ANTLR, a public-domain parser generator that combines the
    flexibility of hand-coded parsing with the convenience of a parser
    generator, which is a component of PCCTS. ANTLR has many features that make
    it easier to use than other language tools. Most important, ANTLR provides
    predicates which let the programmer systematically direct the parse via
    arbitrary expressions using semantic and syntactic context; in practice,
  the use of predicates eliminates the need to hand-tweak the ANTLR output,
  even for difficult parsing problems. ANTLR also integrates the description of
    lexical and syntactic analysis, accepts LL(k) grammars for k > 1 with
    extended BNF notation, and can automatically generate abstract syntax
    trees.ANTLR is widely used, with over 1000 registered industrial and
    academic users in 37 countries. It has been ported to many popular systems
    such as the PC, Macintosh, and a variety of UNIX platforms; a commercial
    \CC front-end has been developed as a result of one of our industrial
    collaborations.},

abstract = {There has been much recent interest in languages whose grammar is sufficiently simple 
that an efficient left-to-right parsing algorithm can be mechanically produced from the grammar. 
In this paper, we define LR(k) grammars, which are perhaps the most general ones of this type, 
and they provide the basis for understanding all of the special tricks which have been used in 
the construction of parsing algorithms for languages with simple structure, e.g., algebraic languages.
We give algorithms for deciding if a given grammar satisfies the LR(k) condition, for given k, 
and also give methods for generating recognizes for LR(k) grammars. 
It is shown that the problem of whether or not a grammar is LR(k) for some k is undecidable, 
and the paper concludes by establishing various connections between LR(k) grammars and deterministic languages. 
In particular, the LR(k) condition is a natural analogue, for grammars, of the deterministic condition, for languages.},

abstract = {Despite the power of Parser Expression Grammars (PEGs) and GLR, parsing is not a solved problem. Adding nondeterminism (parser speculation) to traditional LL and LR parsers can lead to unexpected parse-time behavior and introduces practical issues with error handling, single-step debugging, and side-effecting embedded grammar actions. This paper introduces the LL(*) parsing strategy and an associated grammar analysis algorithm that constructs LL(*) parsing decisions from ANTLR grammars. At parse-time, decisions gracefully throttle up from conventional fixed k>=1 lookahead to arbitrary lookahead and, finally, fail over to backtracking depending on the complexity of the parsing decision and the input symbols. LL(*) parsing strength reaches into the context-sensitive languages, in some cases beyond what GLR and PEGs can express. By statically removing as much speculation as possible, LL(*) provides the expressivity of PEGs while retaining LL's good error handling and unrestricted grammar actions. Widespread use of ANTLR (over 70,000 downloads/year) shows that it is effective for a wide variety of applications.},

A special merit of this algorithm is that it is completed in a number of steps proportional to the “cube” of the number of symbols in the tested string. As a byproduct of the grammatical analysis, required by the recognition algorithm, one can obtain, by some additional processing not exceeding the “cube” factor of computational complexity, a parsing matrix—a complete summary of the grammatical structure of the sentence. It is also shown how, by means of a minor modification of the recognition algorithm, one can obtain an integer representing the ambiguity of the sentence, i.e., the number of distinct ways in which that sentence can be generated by the grammar. The recognition algorithm is then simulated on a Turing Machine. It is shown that this simulation likewise requires a number of steps proportional to only the “cube” of the test string length.},
