The theoretical part of this work dwells on the proof of~\cref{Theorem:Gil:Levy}.
Its engineering part is concerned is
  a software implementation that would make JAVA
  such as in~\cref{Figure:fluent} generate
  the required \Java JAVA that realizes the
  defined grammar, so that JAVA such as
  found in~\cref{Figure:toilette:legal} is type-correct,
  whereas JAVA found in~\cref{Figure:toilette:illegal} is not.
†{%
An important side effect of the implementation is that IDEs with built-in JAVA
completion
 (found e.g., in Eclipse~†{\href{http://www.eclipse.org/}{Eclipse home page}} and IntelliJ~†{\href{https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/}{Intellij home page}})
 will assist the programmer in making a correct use of the API.
 }

Accordingly, the contribution of this work is double folded:
  gaining better understanding of the computational expressiveness of
  \Java generics and type hierarchy, and, a better tool
  for designing, experimenting with and perfecting fluent APIs.

How about EBNF\@? Reference perhaps to Anna Beckermans thesis.\cite{Tomer:also try to trace citations from wikipedia}
It can be done. Further research directions might be found in exploring this venue.
