We recognize that the \Java parser spends sub quadratic time 
  on its input.
Therefore, 
  the type checker implicitly implemented with the fluent API implementation, 
  cannot recognize languages whose time of recognition is quadratic or above that. 

Explain why we cannot do general non-deterministic languages. This require quadratic time.
Java type checking works in less than quadratic time. So, if it was possible to 
do general context free languages, it would be possible to break the record 
  \cite{cubic time algorithms}.
It is highly unlikely that such a record is broken incidentally.

The same consideration
For the same reason, it is highly unlikely to be able to do even deterministic context free languages.
   \cite{http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0019995868910875}

   Mention that there might be few languages between union of LR(k) and deterministic context free.

The reason is that Generate works in reasonable time  \Self generates classes which encode, in types, with a bottom-up, left-right time parser.

We show that a particular context free language,
  despite being non-deterministic,  is encodable as fluent API. 
Specifically, consider then language $L$ of all~$αα^r$, where~$α∈Σ^*$,~$Σ=❴a,b❵$:
$L$ is context free since it is defined by the BNF. 
\begin{Grammar}
  \<S> & ::= S | aSa | bsb |ε
\end{Grammar}
It is also non-deterministic~\cite{Tomer:again:start:tracing:from:wikipedia:until:you:find:the excact} 
Nevertheless, it can be represented.
