We provide proof that for every deterministic pushdown automaton,
  there exists a set of \Java type definitions, such that,
  the automaton accepts a string if and only if the corresponding 
  call chain representing the string, type-checks.
A toolkit for encoding such Fluent APIs is presented as a constructive proof.
