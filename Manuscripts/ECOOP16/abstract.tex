This paper is a theoretical study of practical problem:
  the automatic generation of Java Fluent APIs from their specification.
We explain why the problem's core lies with 
  the expressive power of Java generics.
The main result is that this is possible whenever 
  the specification is an instance of the set of deterministic context-free languages,
  which contains most ``practical'' languages.
Other contributions include a collection of techniques and idioms o
  the limited meta-programming possible with Java generics, 
  and an empirical measurement demonstrating that the runtime of
  the ``javac'' compiler of Java the may be exponential in
  the program's length, even for programs composed of 
  a handful of lines and which do not rely on overly 
  complex use of generics.
