The purpose of this study is to explore the ``Fluent API''s trend in
  terms of formal languages.
Our main result is: for every deterministic pushdown automaton,
  there exists a set of \Java type definitions, such that,
  the automaton accepts a string if and only if the corresponding 
  call chain representing the string, type-checks.
A handy toolkit for type-encoding such Fluent APIs is introduced.
We also provide a lower-bound to the theoretical expressiveness of the \Java compiler,
  while showing an example for which the compiler runs in exponential time.
