The purpose of this study is to explore the ``Fluent API''s trend in
  terms of formal languages, specifically, what can and can not be done 
  in \Java.

Our main result is: for every deterministic pushdown automaton,
  there exists a set of \Java type definitions, such that,
  the automaton accepts a string if and only if a corresponding 
  call chain representing the string, type-checks.

In addition, we introduce a handy toolkit for type-encoding Fluent APIs,
and provide a lower-bound to the theoretical expressiveness of the \Java compiler.
  
Due to the compiler's runtime on certain generic types,
  the proposed type-encoding is unfeasible for real applications.
Using those types, we show an example for which the compiler runs in exponential time.
