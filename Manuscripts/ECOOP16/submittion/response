The research's goal was all along:
"how can one \empth{automatically} generate fluent APIs from BNF specifications"?
To some extent, we failed to make a concrete definition of fluent APIs, leaving the reader to extrapolate from experience and a few examples.
The research started with a belief that the theoretical side (i.e., expressiveness) will not pose major problems, and so we decided to deep dive into implementation.
Then, we encountered the epsilon-moves problem and realized that the underlying theoretical question is much harder than initially presumed. 
We concluded that the lack of such software system is caused by this problem, and thus in order to pursue the original goal, one must first confront with the theoretical aspects.
We believe this research closes the gap required to fully implement a fluent API generator, and further research on this topic is already ongoing.
