A recent result shows that the \NonCitingUse{Java} type system and its type-checker are
mighty enough to emulate deterministic pushdown automata (DPDAs), and hence,
capable (disregarding cost) to recognize deterministic context free
languages (DCFGs). The problem is of concrete practical value, since, as it
turns out, this recognition is essential for automatic generation of fluent
APIs from their specification. 

This work advances the state of knowledge, in presenting,  for the first,  an
efficient (specifically linear time) algorithm for generating an automaton, 
implementable within the framework of compile time computation of \NonCitingUse{Java}, which
recognizes (and parses) a given LL(1) language. The generated automaton is 
time efficient, spending a constant amount of time on each symbol of the ``input''. 
Space requirement is also polynomially bounded. 

We implement the algorithm in \Fajita, a prototypical tool to convert a (fluent
API) specification of a certain fluent API design, into an actual implementation.
