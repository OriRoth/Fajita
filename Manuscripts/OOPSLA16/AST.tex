At runtime, \Self generated APIs generate parse trees, using the list
  of productions used in order to parse the current method invocation sequence.

  % Currently, visitors API is not generated. 
  % I prefer not to lie about it we can do one of the following:
  %    1) to write this section, and mention as we intend to soon implement it
  %    2) implement it (if i will have the time)
  %    3) shortly mention that we can generate a visitors API, but not write a whole section.
