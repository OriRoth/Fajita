We took the manually written \Pascal example shown in \cref{section:intuition}
  and tried to check the runtime of the \Java compiler, while compiling
  programs using the templates mechanism in a rather heavy manner.
To stress the compiler, we invoked the \RLLp in such a way, that the 
  stack should be as deep as possible, but it turns out the \Java compiler
  fails to compile such long programs.
