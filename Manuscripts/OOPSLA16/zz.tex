We presented the first practical algorithm for the automatic generation of a
fluent API for \Java from LL grammars.  Future research is extending the
achievement to LR grammars. 

\Fajita, a fluent API software system by itself, is a prototypical
implementation of this algorithmic. 

More work is required to mature \Fajita into a production tool. A stumbling
block is that experimenting with \Fajita we discovered limitations of the \Java
compiler \cc(javac 1.8.0_66_}, sometimes crashing when trying to compile
\Fajita generated code and often applying unnecessary replication in the
representation of types, leading to memory bloat problems.

These limitations are likely to receive more attention by compiler developer as
the use of fluent APIs increases. As the two phenomena happen, advanced
features such as automatic production of ASTs, and EBNF support should become
even more useful.
