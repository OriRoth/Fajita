  \item Reference to emulation of DFA\@. We can only do
        a constant number of moves in each iteration.
  \item~$aⁿbⁿcⁿ$
  \item \Prolog Unification.
  \item We investigated wildcards, intersection types and
        (the rather limited) type inference of 
        Java, but failed to employ these to increase the expressive power of the computation model.
  \item Ecoop results.
  \item Lina reduction
\end{enumerate}

Lina's reduction size :Assume a grammar~$G=⟨Σ,Ξ,P⟩$.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item On the first step, we transform the grammar to a DPDA~$⟨Q,Γ⟩$ (LL(1) - linear grow, LR(1) - exponential blowup)
  \item For an arbitrary~$k$ the size of stack symbols turns to~$Γᵏ$.
  \item The number of states grow to~$Q⨉Γᵏ$.
  \item The number of stack symbols grow to~$Γᵏ⨉(Q²⨉Γ^{2k})^{Q⨉Γᵏ}$
\end{enumerate}
