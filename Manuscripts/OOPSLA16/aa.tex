Fluent APIs are neat.
Code snippets such as 
\begin{quote}
    \parbox[c]{44ex}{\javaInput[]{camel-apache.java.fragment}} 
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
    \parbox[c]{59ex}{\javaInput[]{jOOQ.java.fragment}}‚èé
\end{quote}
are neat.  Designing is complicated,
involving theory of automata, type theory, language design, etc.
