A recent result shows that expressive power of the \Java type system is mighty
enough to emulate deterministic pushdown automata (DPDAs), and hence, capable
(disregarding cost) to recognize deterministic context free languages. As it
turns out, this recognition is essential for automatic generation of fluent
APIs from their specification. 

This paper presents a linear time algorithm for generating the equivlaent
