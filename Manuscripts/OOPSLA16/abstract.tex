The term ‟Fluent API” has become a buzzword. So has the related term
‟DSL”. The objective of this research is to use the power of \Java generics
to combine the two. Specifically, to create a software system, to be called
\Self, that would make the definition of a DSL for fluent API as easy as the
writing an BNF for this DSL\@. And, just like an ouroboros, the definition of this
BNF will be through a fluent API generated by \Self itself.
