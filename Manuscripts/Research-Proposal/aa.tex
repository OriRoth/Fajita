Modern programming languages acquire high-level constructs
  at a staggering rate.
The imminent adoption of closures in \Java and \CC,
  the generators of \CSharp, and ‚Äüconcepts‚Äù in
  \CC are just a few examples.

A theoretical motivation for this work
  is the exploration of the computational
  expressiveness of such features.
For example, it is known (see e.g.,~\cite{Gil:Gutterman:2003} that
  \kk{template}s are Turing complete in the following precise sense:

\begin{Theorem}
  \label{Theorem:Gutterman}
For every Turing machine~$m$‚Ä†{We tacitly assume that a Turing machine
  encodes in it its input}, there exists a \CC program,~$C‚Çò$ such that
\begin{quote}
  compilation of~$C‚Çò$ of terminates if and only if~$m$ halts.
\end{quote}
Furthermore, program~$C‚Çò$ can be effectively‚Ä†{in the computability lingo:
  effective~$‚âà$‚Äü~\emph{there is time
  bounded algorithm for carrying out the task}‚Äù.} generated from~$m$.
\end{Theorem}

Intuitively, the proof relies on the fact that \kk{template}s
  feature recursive invocation and conditionals (in the form of
  ‚Äü\emph{template initialization}‚Äù

In the same fashion, it is mundane to make the judgment that
  \Java's generics are not Turing-complete: all recursive calls
  in these are unconditional.
In one sense, my research shall give a lower bound on the
  expressive power of \Java generics in terms of the Chomsky hierarchy~\cite{Chomsky:1963}.
I hope to show that it is possible to encode context free grammars within the \Java type system,
  in such a way that type-checking is equivalent to membership queries.
This objective is more precisely expressed in the following conjecture.

\begin{Conjecture}
\label{Conjecture:Gil:Levy}
Let~$Œ£$ be finite alphabet.
  Let~$s$ be a \emph{stack automaton}, and let~$ùìõ=ùìõ(s)‚äÜŒ£$ be
  the \emph{formal language} such that~$s$ recognizes‚Ä†{Consult, e.g.,~\cite{Automatim} for precise definitions of these terms}.
Then, there exists a \Java program,~$J‚Çõ$ and a location~$‚Ñì‚ààJ‚Çõ$
such that 
\begin{quote}
  if a string~$Œ±‚ààŒ£$ is
  placed at~$‚Ñì$, then~$J‚Çõ$ type checks, if an only if,~$Œ±‚ààùìõ$.
\end{quote}
Furthermore, program~$J‚Çõ$ can be effectively generated from~$s$.
\end{Conjecture}

The above discussion, formalism and conjecture may seem at first sight to be too abstract
  to be of any practical value.
Repositioning our perspective sheds another light on the topic.
\cref{Theorem:Gutterman} is important not only because it tells us
  that the question of termination of a \CC compiler is as difficult
  the halting problem~\cite{Halting}, but also because it
  is justifies the common belief that there in principle, there
  is no limit to the power of template programming~\cite{Templates:find:6:refs}.

Similarly, \cref{Conjecture:Gil:Levy} has important
  implications to the emerging trend of employing fluent APIs
  to make complex software systems more accessible.
My thesis is that one can employ the conjecture for 
  automatic generation of very rich such APIs.
