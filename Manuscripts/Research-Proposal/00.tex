Processing programming languages
\begin{description}
  \item[Lexical analysis] - the first step of the process in which the character strings generated by the 
  programmer are aggregated to the abstract tokens defined by the language designer.
  \item[Syntactical analysis (parsing) ] - the second step, in which the processed strings of tokens 
  conform to the rules of a formal grammar defined by the language's BNF (or EBNF).
  \item[Semantical analysis] - the next step, usually performed in unison with the previous step, 
  in which the legal token sequences are given their semantic meaning.
\end{description}
Specifically, the proposal is that API design of follows the footsteps of
Accordingly, the designer of a fluent API has to follow these three conceptual
steps.
First is the identification of the \emph{vocabulary}, i.e.,
the set of method calls including type arguments that may take part in the
fluent API.
In this fluent API example
\begin{lcode}{Java}
allowing (any(Object.class))
  ¢¢.method("get.*")
  ¢¢.withNoArguments();
\end{lcode}
then, there are three method calls, and the vocabulary has three items in it.
\begin{itemize}
  \item~$ℓ₁ = \cc{any(Class<?>)}$
  \item~$ℓ₂ = \cc{allowing($ℓ₁$)}$
  \item~$ℓ₃ = \cc{method(String)}$
  \item~$ℓ₄ = \cc{withNoArguments()}$
\end{itemize}
