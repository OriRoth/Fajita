In a world where software is ubiquitous, the question of errors in source code
has become of critical importance. Malfunctioning software could cause all
sorts of disasters, from trading badly in the stock market to emitting lethal
doses of radiation from medical equipment. A helpful tool to mitigate these
faults would be the knowledge of where to anticipate such errors, and also the
methodology that mitigates the appearance of such faults. To this end, we will
attempt to find not only indications to possible faults, but also to measure
the expected quantity of such faults in a method. 

We will analyze empirical data to study the behavior of errors in a code database.
We will extrapolate these findings to more general conclusions
We will attempt; through analysis of empirical data, to estimate a group of functions which will predict the error proneness and density of a given function.
