The theoretical part of this work dwells on the proof of 
  \cref{Conjecture:Gil:Levy}.
Its engineering part is concerned is  
  a software implementation that would make code 
  such as in \cref{Figure:fluent} generate
  the required \Java code that realizes the 
  defined grammar, so that code such as 
  found in \cref{Figure:toilette:legal} is type-correct,
  whereas code found in \cref{Figure:toilette:illegal} is not.
  \footnote{
An important side effect of the implementation is that IDEs with builtin code
completion 
 (found e.g., in Eclipse~\cite{Elcipse} and InteliJ~\cite{InteliJ}) 
 will assist the programmer in making a correct use of the API.
 }

Accordingly, the contribution of this work is double folded:
  gaining better understanding of the computational expressiveness of 
  \Java generics and type hierarchy, and, a better tool 
  for designing, experimenting with and perfecting fluent APIs.
